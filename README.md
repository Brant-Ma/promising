Promising is a simple and tiny implementation of [Promises/A+](http://promisesaplus.com/) specification. The standard tries to focus on providing an `then` method, by which we can interact with a promise. So it does not involve how to create, fulfill or reject a promise.

## Can I use it?

As it does not provides other useful features, and ES6 has already embrace the native Promise object, **you should not use it**.

Just have fun trying it out, or reading the source code for the detail.
